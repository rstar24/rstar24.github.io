`there's a bluebird in my heart that`

`wants to get out`


`but I'm too tough for him,`

`I say, stay in there, I'm not going`

`to let anybody see`

`you.`

`there's a bluebird in my heart that`

`wants to get out`

`but I pour whiskey on him and inhale`

`cigarette smoke`

`and the w****s and the bartenders`

`and the grocery clerks`

`never know that`

`he's`

`in there.`

`there's a bluebird in my heart that`

`wants to get out`

`but I'm too tough for him,`

`I say,`

`stay down, do you want to mess`

`me up?`

`you want to screw up the`

`works?`

`you want to blow my book sales in`

`Europe?`

`there's a bluebird in my heart that`

`wants to get out`

`but I'm too clever, I only let himout`

`at night sometimes`

`when everybody's asleep.`

`I say, I know that you're there,`

`so don't be`

`sad.`

`then I put him back,`

`but he's singing a little`

`in there, I haven't quite let him`

`die`

`and we sleep together like`

`that`

`with our`

`secret pact`

`and it's nice enough to`

`make a man`

`weep, but I don't`

`weep, do`

`you?`
